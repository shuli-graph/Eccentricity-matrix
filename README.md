# Eccentricity-matrix
In 2018， Wang and Standic introduce a new graph matrix, named the anti-adjacency matrix or eccentricity matrix, which is constructed from the distance matrix of a graph by keeping for each row and each column only the largest distances. This matrix can be interpreted as the opposite of the adjacency matrix, which is instead constructed from the distance matrix of a graph by keeping for each row and each column only the distances equal to 1.

This folder is used to share some programme related to eccentricity matrix, with a focus on python and sagemath.
